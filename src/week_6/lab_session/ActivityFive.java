    Question: Age Verification for a Theme Park Ride

    A theme park ride has an age restriction. Only those who are 12 years old or older can go on the ride.
    A visitor wants to try the ride and provides their age:
    int visitorAge = 10; (This value can be changed for testing).
    Check the visitor's age against the age restriction.

    Determine:
    If the visitor is old enough for the ride.
    If the visitor is too young.
    Print out whether the visitor can go on the ride or not.
