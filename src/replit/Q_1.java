/*
     Write a Java program with the following steps:
        I. Create a for loop.
                Initialize the loop variable i to 1.
        Set the condition to run the loop while i is less than or equal to 10.
        Increment the loop variable i by 1 after each iteration.
                II. Inside the loop, print the value of i.
        Expected Output:
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
