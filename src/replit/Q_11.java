             Write a java program with following steps:
        I. Declare and store the following value to a variables.
        1. First variable should have a value of 30
        2. Second variable should have a value of 40
        II. Compare these numbers and print which one of them is bigger using if statement.
        1. Compare if the first number is greater than second number if so,
                print "First number is greater than second number".
        2. Else, print the following message.
                "First number is smaller than second number"
        III. Run your java program.
** Note: Please select the correct name and data types for the above variables. **
** Hint: Look at the below expected output. **
        Expected Output
        First number is smaller than second number
