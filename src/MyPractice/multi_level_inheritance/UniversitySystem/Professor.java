/*
 Method Implementation:
        In the Professor class, override the getDepartment() method to include
         the rank in the department description.

      Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Professor that extends Faculty.
        Add a private member variable: rank (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getRank() to access the rank.
