    If Control Statement

    Real-life analogy:
    Imagine you're about to leave your house. Before you step out, you peek through the window.
    If it's raining, you decide to take an umbrella with you.

    Java-related explanation:

    The "if" control statement in Java allows you to make a decision based on a condition.
    If the condition is true, then the code inside the "if" block gets executed.

if (isRaining) {
    takeUmbrella();
}

if ( Condition ) {


 } else {


 }
