Project: Vehicle Management System

Objective: Understand extending functionality through inheritance.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called Vehicle.
    2. Define private member variables: make (type String) and model (type String).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getMake() and getModel() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called Car that extends Vehicle.
    6. Add a private member variable: numberOfDoors (type int).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getNumberOfDoors() to access the number of doors.
    9. In a main method, create a Car object and display all the details.
