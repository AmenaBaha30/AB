Project: Library Inventory System

Objective: Enhance a base class with additional data using single inheritance.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called LibraryItem.
    2. Define private member variables: title (type String) and yearPublished (type int).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getTitle() and getYearPublished() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called Magazine that extends LibraryItem.
    6. Add a private member variable: issueNumber (type int).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getIssueNumber() to access the issue number.
    9. In a main method, create a Magazine object and display all the details.
