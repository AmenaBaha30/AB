Project: Healthcare Records Management

Objective: Utilize single inheritance in a healthcare context.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called MedicalRecord.
    2. Define private member variables: patientName (type String) and recordNumber (type String).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getPatientName() and getRecordNumber() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called VaccinationRecord that extends MedicalRecord.
    6. Add a private member variable: vaccineType (type String).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getVaccineType() to access the vaccine type.
    9. In a main method, create a VaccinationRecord object and display all the details.
