Project: Pet Records Management

Objective: Utilize inheritance for enhanced class design.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called Animal.
    2. Define private member variables: species (type String) and age (type int).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getSpecies() and getAge() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called Dog that extends Animal.
    6. Add a private member variable: breed (type String).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getBreed() to access the breed.
    9. In a main method, create a Dog object and display all the details.
