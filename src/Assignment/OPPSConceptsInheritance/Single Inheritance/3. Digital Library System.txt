Project: Digital Library System

Objective: Practice inheritance with additional attributes.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called Book.
    2. Define private member variables: title (type String) and author (type String).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getTitle() and getAuthor() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called EBook that extends Book.
    6. Add a private member variable: fileSize (type double).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getFileSize() to access the file size.
    9. In a main method, create an EBook object and display all the details.
