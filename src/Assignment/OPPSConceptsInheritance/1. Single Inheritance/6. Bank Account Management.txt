Project: Bank Account Management

Objective: Apply single inheritance in a financial context.

Steps:

    1. Create a base class called Account.
    2. Define private member variables: accountNumber (type String) and balance (type double).
    3. Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
    4. Implement public methods getAccountNumber() and getBalance() to access these variables.
    5. Create a derived class called SavingsAccount that extends Account.
    6. Add a private member variable: interestRate (type double).
    7. Provide a constructor to initialize all variables.
    8. Implement public method getInterestRate() to access the interest rate.
    9. In a main method, create a SavingsAccount object and display all the details.
