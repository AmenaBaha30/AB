Project 9: Sports Team Management System

Objective: Practice creating a multi-level inheritance structure with additional functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called TeamMember.
        Define private member variables: name (type String), memberId (type String), and position (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getName(), getMemberId(), and getPosition() to access these variables.

    First Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Player that extends TeamMember.
        Add a private member variable: jerseyNumber (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getJerseyNumber() to access the jersey number.

    Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Captain that extends Player.
        Add a private member variable: yearsAsCaptain (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getYearsAsCaptain() to access the years as captain.

    Method Implementation:
        In the Captain class, override the getPosition() method to include years as captain in the position description.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create a Captain object and display all its details, including those from the TeamMember and Player classes, and the updated position details.
