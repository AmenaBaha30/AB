Project 5: Bank Account Management System

Objective: Practice creating a multi-level inheritance structure with additional functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called BankAccount.
        Define private member variables: accountNumber (type String), balance (type double), and accountHolder (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getAccountNumber(), getBalance(), and getAccountHolder() to access these variables.

    First Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called SavingsAccount that extends BankAccount.
        Add a private member variable: interestRate (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getInterestRate() to access the interest rate.

    Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called FixedDepositAccount that extends SavingsAccount.
        Add a private member variable: maturityPeriod (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getMaturityPeriod() to access the maturity period.

    Method Implementation:
        In the FixedDepositAccount class, override the getBalance() method to include
        interest based on the maturity period.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create a FixedDepositAccount object and display all its details, including those from
        the BankAccount and SavingsAccount classes, and the updated balance details.
