Project 7: Hospital Management System

Objective: Practice creating a multi-level inheritance structure with additional functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Person.
        Define private member variables: name (type String) and age (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getName() and getAge() to access these variables.

    First Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Patient that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: patientId (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getPatientId() to access the patient ID.

    Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called InPatient that extends Patient.
        Add a private member variable: roomNumber (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getRoomNumber() to access the room number.

    Method Implementation:
        In the InPatient class, override the getAge() method to include the room number in the age description.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create an InPatient object and display all its details, including those from the Person and Patient classes, and the updated age details.
