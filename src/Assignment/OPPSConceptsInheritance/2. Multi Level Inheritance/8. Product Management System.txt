Project 8: Product Management System

Objective: Practice creating a multi-level inheritance structure with additional functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Product.
        Define private member variables: productId (type String), productName (type String), and price (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getProductId(), getProductName(), and getPrice() to access these variables.

    First Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Electronics that extends Product.
        Add a private member variable: warrantyPeriod (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getWarrantyPeriod() to access the warranty period.

    Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called Laptop that extends Electronics.
        Add a private member variable: batteryLife (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getBatteryLife() to access the battery life.

    Method Implementation:
        In the Laptop class, override the getProductName() method to include battery life in the product name.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create a Laptop object and display all its details, including those from the Product and Electronics classes, and the updated product name details.
