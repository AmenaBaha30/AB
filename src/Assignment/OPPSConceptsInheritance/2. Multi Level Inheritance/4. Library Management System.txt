Project 4: Library Management System

Objective: Practice creating a multi-level inheritance structure with additional functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Book.
        Define private member variables: title (type String), author (type String), and ISBN (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getTitle(), getAuthor(), and getISBN() to access these variables.

    First Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called LibraryBook that extends Book.
        Add a private member variable: libraryId (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getLibraryId() to access the library ID.

    Second Level of Inheritance:
        Create a derived class called ReferenceBook that extends LibraryBook.
        Add a private member variable: referenceSection (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getReferenceSection() to access the reference section.

    Method Implementation:
        In the ReferenceBook class, override the getAuthor() method to include the reference
        section in the author description.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create a ReferenceBook object and display all its details,
         including those from the Book and LibraryBook classes, and the updated author details.
