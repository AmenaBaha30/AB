Project 7: Tech Gadgets Management System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure
 with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Gadget.
        Define private member variables: brand (type String), model (type String),
         and price (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getBrand(), getModel(), and getPrice() to access
        these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Smartphone that extends Gadget.
        Add a private member variable: screenSize (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables,
         including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getScreenSize() to access the screen size.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Laptop that extends Gadget.
        Add a private member variable: ram (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables,
         including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getRam() to access the RAM.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Tablet that extends Gadget.
        Add a private member variable: batteryLife (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables,
         including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getBatteryLife() to access the battery life.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of Smartphone, Laptop,
         and Tablet and display all their details, including those from the Gadget class.
