Project 8: Sports League Management System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Person.
        Define private member variables: name (type String) and age (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getName() and getAge() to access these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Player that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: team (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getTeam() to access the team.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Coach that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: yearsOfExperience (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getYearsOfExperience() to access the years of experience.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Referee that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: certificationLevel (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getCertificationLevel() to access the certification level.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of Player, Coach, and Referee and display all their details, including those from the Person class.
