Project 5: Appliance Management System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Appliance.
        Define private member variables: brand (type String), model (type String), and power (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getBrand(), getModel(), and getPower() to access these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called WashingMachine that extends Appliance.
        Add a private member variable: capacity (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getCapacity() to access the capacity.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Refrigerator that extends Appliance.
        Add a private member variable: volume (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getVolume() to access the volume.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Microwave that extends Appliance.
        Add a private member variable: wattage (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getWattage() to access the wattage.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of WashingMachine, Refrigerator, and Microwave and display all their details, including those from the Appliance class.
