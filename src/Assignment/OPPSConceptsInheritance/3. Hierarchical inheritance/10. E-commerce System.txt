Project 10: E-commerce System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Product.
        Define private member variables: productId (type String), productName (type String), and price (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getProductId(), getProductName(), and getPrice() to access these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Electronics that extends Product.
        Add a private member variable: warranty (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getWarranty() to access the warranty.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Clothing that extends Product.
        Add a private member variable: size (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getSize() to access the size.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Food that extends Product.
        Add a private member variable: expirationDate (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getExpirationDate() to access the expiration date.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of Electronics, Clothing, and Food and display all their details, including those from the Product class.
