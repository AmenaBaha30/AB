Project 2: Vehicle Management System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Vehicle.
        Define private member variables: make (type String), model (type String), and year (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getMake(), getModel(), and getYear() to access these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Car that extends Vehicle.
        Add a private member variable: numberOfDoors (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getNumberOfDoors() to access the number of doors.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Truck that extends Vehicle.
        Add a private member variable: payloadCapacity (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getPayloadCapacity() to access the payload capacity.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Motorcycle that extends Vehicle.
        Add a private member variable: hasSidecar (type boolean).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getHasSidecar() to access the hasSidecar variable.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of Car, Truck, and Motorcycle and display all their details, including those from the Vehicle class.
