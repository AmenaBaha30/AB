Project 6: Banking System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called BankAccount.
        Define private member variables: accountNumber (type String), accountHolder (type String), and balance (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getAccountNumber(), getAccountHolder(), and getBalance() to access these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called SavingsAccount that extends BankAccount.
        Add a private member variable: interestRate (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getInterestRate() to access the interest rate.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called CheckingAccount that extends BankAccount.
        Add a private member variable: overdraftLimit (type double).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getOverdraftLimit() to access the overdraft limit.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called FixedDepositAccount that extends BankAccount.
        Add a private member variable: maturityPeriod (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getMaturityPeriod() to access the maturity period.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of SavingsAccount, CheckingAccount, and FixedDepositAccount and display all their details, including those from the BankAccount class.
