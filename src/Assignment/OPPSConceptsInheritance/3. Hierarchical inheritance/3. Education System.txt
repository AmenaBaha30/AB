Project 3: Education System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Person.
        Define private member variables: name (type String) and age (type int).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getName() and getAge() to access these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Student that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: studentId (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getStudentId() to access the student ID.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Teacher that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: employeeId (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getEmployeeId() to access the employee ID.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Administrator that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: adminId (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getAdminId() to access the admin ID.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of Student, Teacher, and Administrator and display all their details, including those from the Person class.
