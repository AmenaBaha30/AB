Project 9: Medical System

Objective: Practice creating a hierarchical inheritance structure with shared base class functionality.

Steps:

    Base Class Creation:
        Create a base class called Person.
        Define private member variables: name (type String), age (type int), and gender (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize these variables.
        Implement public methods getName(), getAge(), and getGender() to access these variables.

    First Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Doctor that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: specialization (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getSpecialization() to access the specialization.

    Second Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Nurse that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: shift (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getShift() to access the shift.

    Third Derived Class:
        Create a derived class called Technician that extends Person.
        Add a private member variable: department (type String).
        Provide a constructor to initialize all variables, including those in the base class.
        Implement a public method getDepartment() to access the department.

    Testing:
        In the main method, create objects of Doctor, Nurse, and Technician and display all their details, including those from the Person class.
